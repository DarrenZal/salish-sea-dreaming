# Salish Sea Dreaming

Interactive AI art installation exploring the Salish Sea ecosystem through TouchDesigner.

## Project Context

This is a creative/artistic project for the Salt Spring Spring Art Show (April 2026).
The vision: not humans looking at nature through technology, but the Salish Sea using
technology to perceive itself.

## TouchDesigner Integration

This project uses the TouchDesigner MCP. When TD is running with the MCP component active,
you can directly create and modify nodes, run Python scripts, and query the project state.

Key TD tools: `create_td_node`, `get_td_nodes`, `execute_python_script`, `update_td_node_parameters`

## Files

- `examples/` - TouchDesigner `.toe` files with working visualizations
- Keep visualizations nature-focused: particles, flocking, organic movement

## Style

- Favor emergent, organic behaviors over mechanical precision
- Think: plankton, currents, bioluminescence, flocking fish, kelp forests
